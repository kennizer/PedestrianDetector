I changed the hidden units from 20->40 and 
the improvement spiked earlier than in problem 1...

At Epoch 39, it was an improvement of 0.6% so it seems like
the progrram stagnates over time but at earlier Epoches
At Epoch 29, there is a gap around 2% of improved accuracy for 
testing from Problem 1 and Problem 2. 
At epoch 31, there is a 4% gap of improved accuracy for testing
from Problem 1 to Problem 2
